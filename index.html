                    Each card (round) has 7 prompts. The game starts by reading off the first prompt.
                    Everyone writes down an answer to the prompt. As long as you write down a correct answer
                    that no one else wrote down, you survive and make it to the next prompt. If you wrote down
                    an incorrect answer or an answer that someone else wrote down, you're out until the next round.
                    Play proceeds until either 1 person is left or until the 7th prompt is complete.
                    It's possible that everyone could get knocked out and no one wins the round, and it's
                    possible that more than 1 person could make it through all 7 prompts to win the round.<br /><br />
                    
                    If at any point in the game there is a question about whether someone's answer is legitimate,
                    everyone (including the player in question and the players who have already been knocked out)
                    votes on it. Majority rules. If there's a tie, the player in question is safe.
